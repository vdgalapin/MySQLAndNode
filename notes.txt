If you already have node and npm

start of with 
    'npm init'
    Change the main depending on what the name of your entry server script. I used server.js so it will be 'server.js'
    Then I will change the start which is the command to start the application to 'node server.js' in the scripts with start

install packages
    npm install -s express ==> -s is important so it will save to your package.json

    npm install -s mysql 

    npm install -s ejs ==> for default view engine

if you want to move page to page it has to be ejs.
    you have to put this pages in a folder name view for ejs to work

install nodemon for automatically reload the node js app   
    npm install nodemon

    change the script start in package.json to nodemon whateverapp.js

To display flash message in nodejs using connect-flash. It will also required express-session.
    npm install -s express-session  == first
    npm install -s connect-flash    == second

    // So its not going to work
    "Flash messages" are used to carry a message over to the next request, and most of the time the only reason is the post-request-get pattern. 
    If you just want to show a message to the user on the same page, while not doing a redirect, you don't need a library for it. Just pass the 
    message to the template as data.
