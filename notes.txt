If you already have node and npm

start of with 
    'npm init'
    Change the main depending on what the name of your entry server script. I used server.js so it will be 'server.js'
    Then I will change the start which is the command to start the application to 'node server.js'

install packages
    npm install -s express ==> -s is important so it will save to your package.json

    npm install -s mysql 

    npm install -s ejs ==> for default view engine

if you want to move page to page it has to be ejs.
    you have to put this pages in a folder name view for ejs to work
